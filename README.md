The goal of this project is to (1) detect the descriptor that influence the costumer churn and (2) build a model to predict the costumer churn.
The dataset used is availbale on Kaggle: https://tinyurl.com/ud43n28s

## 1. Introduction
### What is costumer churn ?

" Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service. Also known as customer attrition, customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers " - Molly Galetto (https://tinyurl.com/yjs9shrk)



Customer churn is a critical metric for banks. Indeed, a costumers leaving represents a significant investment lost. Both time and effort need to be channelled into replacing them. The prediction of the costumer churn is a powerful tool for the bank to avoid this lost.

In this project, I will dig into the data, visualise them and build a model to predict the costumer churn. I will use a random forest and logistic regression algorithm.

## 2. Data exploration 

Here is the descriptors avaible on the data set:

- RowNumber          10000 non-null int64
- CustomerId         10000 non-null int64
- Surname            10000 non-null object
- CreditScore        10000 non-null int64
- Geography          10000 non-null object
- Gender             10000 non-null object
- Age                10000 non-null int64
- Tenure             10000 non-null int64
- Balance            10000 non-null float64
- NumOfProducts      10000 non-null int64
- HasCrCard          10000 non-null int64
- IsActiveMember     10000 non-null int64
- EstimatedSalary    10000 non-null float64
- Exited             10000 non-null int64

There are 14 descriptors and 10000 entry. There is no missing values on the dataset (Good news ðŸ¥³)

However, we can see that some descriptors are useless for the purpose of this project. Indeed, the row number, the customer id, and the surname do not play a role in the customer churn. These descriptors will be remove for the rest of the project.

we can distinguished two type of descriptors: continuous and categorical descritors. I will visualise them separately.

### Data visualisation

First, I look at the proportion of customers who left the company on this dataset:

![donut_churn_percent](Results/donut_churn_percent.png)

It appears that 20.4% of the customers left the bank in this dataset. We can see an over-representation of the retained customers in this dataset, this imbalance can bias the modeling.

### Categorical variables 

![HeatMapCatFeatures](Results/HeatMapCatFeatures.png)

Here, the categorical variables gives us some interesting information:
- The churn rate is higher for women than men
- The churn rate is higher for the german customers (highest churn rate). French and Spanish customers have the same churn rate. It could be interesting to put the spanish and the french in the same group
- Having a credit is not key feature for the customer churn
- As expected, non-active members present a higher chrun rate

### Continuous variables

![violinPlot_continuous](Results/violinPlot_continuous.png)

Here, the continuous variables gives us some interresting information:
- The credits score is not different between the churned and retained customers.
- The average age of the retained customers seems to be lower than the churned customers.
- The tenure do not seems to be different between the churned and retained customers.
- We can see a clear difference in the balance of the churned and retained customers.
- The retained customers present mostly one or two products.
- The estimated salary do not seems to be different between the churned and retained customers.

#### let's check the density of Age and Balance descriptors:

##### Age
![density_age](Results/density_age.png)

    The avgerage age of churned customers is 44.84 against 37.41 for the retained customers

Indeed, the average age of the cherned customers is higher than the retained customers (37 vs 45).
This information is crucial for the modeling.

##### Balance

![Density_Balances](Results/Density_Balance.png)

    The avgerage age of churned customers is 91108.54 against 72745.3 for the retained customers

For the balcance, we can see two peaks both distributions: 0 and around 125 000. we can see that there are more customers with a balance = 0 that stayed on the bank. This is even more visble on the following barplot:

![count_balance_zeros](Results/count_balance_zeros.png)

I noticed that the customers with a non-null balance are part of the retained customers. Let's make a categorical variable based on this information.

# 3. Data preprocessing

## Descriptor engineering

In this section I will create new descriptors based on the last section.

I made two observations on the continuous variables:

(1) customers with a high number of products tend to leave the bank
(2) customers with a balance non-null tend to leave the bank

let's make two descriptors based on these observations

## Dropping of the non-useful descriptors

Based of the last analysis we point out some non-essential features: 'Tenure', 'HasCrCard', 'EstimatedSalary'. Let's drop them!

## Encoding of categorical descriptors

Encoding of: 

- The gender (1: Male;0: female)
- Geography. As Mentioned above, I will merge spain and french customers (0: Spain + France; 1: Germany)
- for the active members, I will change the coding for -1 when the customers is an aactive member.


## Scaling the continuous descriptors

I will scale the continuous descriptors with the Min Max Scaler.

# Models Building

I will build two model using Logistic regression and random forest. The advatage of random forest is that we can extract the importance of each descriptor for the model.

## Logistic regression

### Remarks on the logistic regression model:

We obtained a precision of 0.70

## Random Forest

# Conclusion

In this project, I built a model to predict the bank customer churn. First, I explore the dataset, I found that:
- The churn rate is higher for the german customers (highest churn rate). French and Spanish customers have the same churn rate. 
- Having a credit is not key feature for the customer churn
- Non-active members present a higher chrun rate
- The average age of the retained customers seems to be lower than the churned customers
- We can see a clear difference in the balance of the churned and retained customers
- The retained customers present mostly one or two products

The importance analysis with the random forest methods confirm these observation.
